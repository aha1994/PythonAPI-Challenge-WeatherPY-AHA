From the Max Temperature vs Latitude scatter plot, it appears that the max temperature
seems to increase from -40 degrees latitude to about 20 degrees latitude. From
20 degrees to 80 degrees, the max temperature decreases. There are a few
cities that sort of break the trend, noticably the one at -30 latitude and
~105 degrees max temperature. 

Overall, the bulk of cities fell between the 80-100% humidty range. There is
a noticable gap in the scatter plot between -20 and 20 on the x axis, and from
0 to 60 on the y axis. This would suggest that cities near the equator rarely
get below 60% humidity. In contrast, cities that had a latitude of -20 degrees
displayed humidities almost over the enitre range of y values.

Five distinct lines formed on the cloud coverage vs latitude scatter plot.
These lines appear to be at 0, 20, 40, 75, and 100. This suggests that
the cloud coverage might tend to be rounded or estimated to these whole
values. Noticably, these lines extend over the the range of laititude values,
suggesting that cloud coverage isn't not strongly related to latitude.

Overall, the majority of cities had a wind speed of 10 mph or less.
There is a gap in points on the plot from -20 to 20 latitude, and a wind speed
above 15. This would weakly suggest that near the equator there is less 
chance of experiencing a high wind speed.Interestingly, the highest windspeed was located at the city with the most
negative (southern) latitude value.
